# Ethics convergence (imperfect systems)
The original wrapper attempted to treat perfect systems (κ = 0 everywhere)
using the same inequality `MoralProgress > 1 - ε`, which is impossible
because `MoralProgress` is defined to be `0` for perfect systems.  We
therefore refine the statement to **exclude** perfect systems explicitly.
