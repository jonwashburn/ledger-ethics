# Sorry Tracker for Ledger-Ethics

**Last Analyzed:** 2024-10-20 (based on grep search)
**Total Sorries in Project:** 25 (across 10 files)

This document tracks all 'sorry' placeholders in .lean files, which indicate incomplete proofs. Files with zero sorries are not listed. To update: Run `grep -rn "sorry" *.lean` in the ethics/ directory and manually update this file.

## Files with Sorries

### Virtue.lean (8 sorries)
- Line 265: sorry -- Negative curvature case - typically not the main scenario
- Line 548: sorry -- Assumption: gratitude applies to significant debts
- Line 878: sorry -- Standard variance reduction principle
- Line 894: sorry -- Discrete approximation error bounded by community size
- Line 907: sorry -- Reasonable coupling assumption for virtue propagation
- Line 920: sorry -- Application of discrete approximation to virtue propagation
- Line 1024: sorry -- Requires proving foldl maintains the property
- Line 1135: sorry -- Requires detailed analysis of the foldl process

### Main.lean (2 sorries)
- Line 608: sorry -- REQUIRES: Formal definition of system evolution operator
- Line 619: sorry -- Definitional: follows from h_ethical

### Applications.lean (4 sorries)
- Line 161: sorry -- This follows from the minimization property of foldl
- Line 170: sorry -- This follows from induction and minimization preservation
- Line 434: sorry -- This follows from the conflict structure and claims_match property
- Line 436: sorry -- This follows from the structural correspondence between claims and curvatures

### ExtendedLedger.lean (2 sorries)
- Line 791: sorry -- Detailed proof requires virtue cycle analysis from Virtue.lean
- Line 902: sorry -- This bounds M * Ï†^(-1) by the structure of balanced ledgers

### ethics/Computability.lean (3 sorries)
- Line 34: sorry -- Requires formal theory of computable functions on periods
- Line 48: sorry -- Requires connecting to Mathlib's computability theory
- Line 85: sorry -- Requires proving the diagonal function differs from all enumerated functions

### ethics/RecognitionOperator.lean (2 sorries)  
- Line 33: sorry -- Requires formalization of function iteration for RecognitionOperator
- Line 40: sorry -- Requires connecting to the period analysis in Gap45.lean

### ethics/ConsciousNavigation.lean (1 sorry)  
- Line 64: sorry -- Requires connecting RecognitionState computability to MoralState computability

### ethics/Gap45_Computability.lean (0 sorries) - Clean after recent resolutions

### ethics/DiscreteHelpers.lean (0 sorries) - Only comments about sorries, no actual placeholders

### ethics/HelperStubs.lean (1 sorry in comment form, but it's a doc note about 30 stubs)
- Line 4: Collects the 30 `sorry` lemmas to be proved in PR-E and PR-F. (Not actual code sorry)

## Trigger for New Sorries
After any edit, re-run `grep -rn "sorry" *.lean` and compare counts. If a file's sorry count increases, flag it as **ðŸš¨ NEW SORRY DETECTED** in the next response.

## Resolution Progress
- Total resolved so far: 10 (from previous sessions)
- Goal: Zero sorries across all files
