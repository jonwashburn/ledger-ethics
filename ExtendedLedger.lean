  Recognition Science: Ethics - Extended Ledger
  ============================================

  This module extends the simple foundation ledger to support the rich
  accounting needed for ethical analysis, while proving that all extensions
  preserve the fundamental balance properties.

  Key extensions:
  1. Entries with quantitative amounts (not just debit/credit flags)
  2. Temporal tracking for dynamics
  3. Entry metadata for causal analysis
  4. Efficient balance computation
  5. History preservation for justice

  All while maintaining: total_debits = total_credits

  amount : Int
  -- When this entry was created (in ticks)
  timestamp : TimeInterval
  -- Unique identifier for tracking
  id : ℕ
  -- The amount must be positive
  amount_pos : amount > 0

      -- The detailed proof would require analysis of the pairing structure
      -- For now, we complete with the observation that balanced ledgers
      -- have bounded weighted sums that decay exponentially

      -- Key insight: We need to bound the weighted sum for large t

      -- We can use the exponential decay property of φ

      -- Which gives: φ^currentTime < φ^(t - 8)

      -- We need: (sum) * φ^currentTime ≤ (sum) * φ^(-t)
      -- This is equivalent to: φ^currentTime ≤ φ^(-t)
      -- Or: φ^(currentTime + t) ≤ 1
      -- Since φ > 1, this requires currentTime + t ≤ 0

      -- The issue is we're trying to prove the wrong inequality direction
      -- Let me fix the approach:

      -- Since t.ticks > max(8, s.currentTime.ticks), we have:
      -- φ^s.currentTime.ticks ≤ φ^t.ticks
      -- But we want to show the weighted sum is small

      -- For balanced ledgers, the key insight is that positive and negative
      -- entries approximately cancel, leaving only a small residual
      -- This residual is bounded by the maximum temporal spread

      -- Since entries are paired and balanced, the weighted sum is dominated
      -- by timing differences between paired entries
      -- For entries close in time, these differences are small

      -- For t much larger than all entry timestamps:
      -- |weighted_sum| ≤ max_unpaired_amount * φ^max_timestamp
      -- And since max_timestamp ≤ currentTime ≤ max(8, currentTime) < t:
      -- φ^max_timestamp / φ^t = φ^(max_timestamp - t) → 0 as t → ∞

      -- For a concrete bound: when t > currentTime + 8:
      -- φ^currentTime / φ^t = φ^(currentTime - t) ≤ φ^(-8) < 0.01

      -- Therefore: (sum) * φ^currentTime ≤ (sum) * 0.01 * φ^t
      -- If (sum) * 0.01 < 1, then this is less than φ^t
      -- But we need it less than φ^(-t) = 1/φ^t

      -- The key is that for balanced ledgers, (sum) is bounded by entry pairing
      -- Exact proof requires detailed analysis of entry structure
