  Recognition Science: Ethics - Virtues
  ====================================

  Virtues are proven technologies for curvature management.
  Each virtue represents an optimization algorithm discovered
  through evolutionary selection for ledger balance.

  No new axioms - virtues emerge from recognition dynamics.

# Classical Virtues as Curvature Technologies

## Theoretical Foundation

Each virtue implements a specific curvature reduction strategy:
- **Love**: Equilibrates curvature through resonant coupling (φ-based)
- **Justice**: Ensures accurate ledger posting (8-beat verification)
- **Forgiveness**: Prevents cascade failures through debt cancellation
- **Courage**: Maintains coherence in high-gradient regions
- **Wisdom**: Optimizes over extended time horizons

The specific numerical values are derived from:
1. Recognition quantum E_coh = 0.090 eV
2. Eight-beat cycle structure
3. Golden ratio scaling φ ≈ 1.618
4. Empirical validation from virtue studies
