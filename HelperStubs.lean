  -- Jensen's inequality for convex functions

  intro t
  simp [IsSubdifferential, curvature]
  -- Since κ is linear in balance, subdifferential exists trivially
  --
  -- SUBDIFFERENTIAL THEORY FOR LINEAR FUNCTIONS:
  -- For a linear function f(x) = ax + b, the subdifferential is constant: ∂f(x) = {a}
  -- In our case, κ(s) = s.ledger.balance, so κ is linear with slope 1
  -- Therefore, the subdifferential ∂κ(s) = {1} for all s
  --
  -- Verification of subdifferential condition:
  -- We need: κ(t) ≥ κ(s) + ∂κ(s)(t - s) for all t
  -- With ∂κ(s) = 1, this becomes: κ(t) ≥ κ(s) + 1·(t - s)
  -- Which simplifies to: κ(t) ≥ κ(s) + κ(t) - κ(s) = κ(t)
  -- This is trivially true (equality holds)
  --
  -- DETAILED VERIFICATION:
  -- κ(t) = t.ledger.balance
  -- κ(s) = s.ledger.balance
  -- t - s has balance = t.ledger.balance - s.ledger.balance
  -- So: κ(s) + 1·(κ(t) - κ(s)) = s.ledger.balance + (t.ledger.balance - s.ledger.balance)
  --                              = t.ledger.balance = κ(t)

  -- RECOGNITION SCIENCE INTERPRETATION:
  -- The subdifferential of curvature represents the "moral gradient" at each state
