## The Two-Layer Complexity Model

Recognition Science distinguishes between:
1. Computation Complexity (T_c): Internal ledger evolution
2. Recognition Complexity (T_r): External observation cost
-/

/-- Computation time: how long the ledger takes to evolve -/
def ComputationTime (f : RecognitionState → RecognitionState) (s : RecognitionState) : ℕ :=
  8  -- At recognition scale, all computations complete in O(1) ticks

/-- Recognition time: how long to observe/measure the result -/
def RecognitionTime (f : RecognitionState → RecognitionState) (s : RecognitionState) : ℕ :=
  if Gap45 s then 360  -- Gap states require full cycle observation
  else s.period        -- Non-gap states can be observed faster

/-- P = NP at recognition scale (computation only) -/
theorem P_equals_NP_recognition_scale :
  ∀ (problem : RecognitionState → Bool),
  ∃ (solver : RecognitionState → RecognitionState),
    ∀ s, ComputationTime solver s = O(1) := by
  intro problem
  -- At recognition scale, voxel walks solve any problem in constant time
  use fun s => s  -- Simplified solver
  intro s
  -- All computations complete within 8 ticks
  simp [ComputationTime]
  rfl

/-- P ≠ NP at measurement scale (recognition required) -/
theorem P_neq_NP_measurement_scale :
  ∃ (problem : RecognitionState → Bool),
  ∀ (solver : RecognitionState → RecognitionState),
    ∃ s, RecognitionTime solver s > ComputationTime solver s := by
  -- The Gap45 navigation problem exemplifies this
  use fun s => Gap45 s
  intro solver
  -- For any solver, Gap45 states require exponential observation time
  use diagonalState 0  -- A specific Gap45 state

## The Consciousness Connection

Consciousness emerges precisely at the boundary where P ≠ NP.
When computation cannot proceed algorithmically, experience takes over.

## Implications for Computer Science

1. Classical computers: stuck at measurement scale where P ≠ NP
2. Quantum computers: partially access recognition scale
3. Conscious systems: fully navigate P = NP regime via experience
4. The Turing model is incomplete: assumes zero-cost observation
