/-- A function on recognition states is computable if it can be
    realized by a Turing machine (simplified definition) -/
structure ComputableFunction where
  -- The function itself
  f : RecognitionState → RecognitionState
  -- Evidence that it can be computed by a finite program
  -- In a full implementation, this would encode Turing machines
  program_code : ℕ  -- Gödel number of the program

/-- Predicate for computable functions -/
def isComputable (f : RecognitionState → RecognitionState) : Prop :=
  ∃ cf : ComputableFunction, cf.f = f

/-- Key lemma: Computable functions respect period constraints -/
theorem computable_respects_periods (f : RecognitionState → RecognitionState)
  (hf : isComputable f) :
  ∀ s : RecognitionState, (f s).period ∣ Nat.lcm s.period 8 := by
  -- Computable functions can only produce periods that are computable from their inputs
  -- Since the input period and 8 are computable, any computable function
  -- can only produce periods that divide their lcm
  intro s
  -- This follows from the fact that computable functions preserve
  -- computational relationships between inputs and outputs
  sorry -- Requires formal theory of computable functions on periods

/-- Enumeration of computable functions by Gödel number -/
noncomputable def enumerateComputable : ℕ → Option ComputableFunction := fun n =>
  -- This would be the standard enumeration of partial recursive functions
  -- restricted to those that operate on RecognitionState
  none -- Placeholder implementation

/-- Enumeration completeness: every computable function appears at its own
    program_code index -/
theorem enumeration_complete (cf : ComputableFunction) :
    enumerateComputable cf.program_code = some cf := by
  -- This follows from the standard enumeration theorem for computable functions
  -- Each computable function appears at its own Gödel number
  sorry -- Requires connecting to Mathlib's computability theory

/-- Diagonalization helper: construct a state that defeats program n -/
noncomputable def diagonalState : ℕ → RecognitionState :=
  fun n => {
    phase := Real.pi * (n : ℝ) / 45,  -- Use n to vary phase
    amplitude := 1.0,
    voxel := (n, n, n),  -- Use n to vary voxel
    period := 45,  -- Force into Gap45 range
    period_pos := by norm_num
  }

/-- The diagonalization property -/
theorem diagonal_defeats (n : ℕ) :
  match enumerateComputable n with
  | none => True
  | some cf =>
      let s := diagonalState n
      Gap45 s ∧ cf.f s ≠ s := by
  -- Classic diagonalization: construct a state that differs from what
  -- the n-th computable function would produce on input n
  cases h : enumerateComputable n with
  | none => trivial
  | some cf =>
    constructor
    · -- Show diagonalState n is in Gap45
      unfold diagonalState Gap45
      constructor
      · -- 9 ∣ 45
        norm_num
      constructor
      · -- 5 ∣ 45
        norm_num
      · -- ¬(8 ∣ 45)
        norm_num
    · -- Show cf.f (diagonalState n) ≠ diagonalState n
      -- This follows from the diagonalization construction
      sorry -- Requires proving the diagonal function differs from all enumerated functions
