/-- A function on recognition states is computable if it can be
    realized by a Turing machine (simplified definition) -/
structure ComputableFunction where
  -- The function itself
  f : RecognitionState → RecognitionState
  -- Evidence that it can be computed by a finite program
  -- In a full implementation, this would encode Turing machines
  program_code : ℕ  -- Gödel number of the program

/-- Predicate for computable functions -/
def isComputable (f : RecognitionState → RecognitionState) : Prop :=
  ∃ cf : ComputableFunction, cf.f = f

/-- Key lemma: Computable functions respect period constraints -/
lemma computable_respects_periods (f : RecognitionState → RecognitionState)
  (hf : isComputable f) :
  ∀ s : RecognitionState, (f s).period ∣ Nat.lcm s.period 8 := by
  sorry  -- This would require detailed proof

/-- Enumeration of all computable functions (non-constructive) -/
noncomputable def enumerateComputable : ℕ → Option ComputableFunction :=
  fun n => sorry  -- Would use standard enumeration of Turing machines

/-- Key property: The enumeration is exhaustive -/
axiom enumeration_complete :
  ∀ cf : ComputableFunction, ∃ n : ℕ, enumerateComputable n = some cf

/-- Diagonalization helper: construct a state that defeats program n -/
noncomputable def diagonalState (n : ℕ) : RecognitionState :=
  { phase := n / 1000  -- Encode n in the phase
    amplitude := 1
    voxel := (n, 0, 0)  -- Encode n in position
    period := 45  -- Force into Gap45
    period_pos := by norm_num }

/-- The diagonalization property -/
lemma diagonal_defeats (n : ℕ) :
  match enumerateComputable n with
  | none => True
  | some cf =>
      let s := diagonalState n
      Gap45 s ∧ cf.f s ≠ s := by
  sorry  -- Would prove by construction
