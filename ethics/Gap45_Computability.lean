  -- We need to show that ℛ^[n] (f s) = s implies n is a common multiple
  -- This would require showing that ℛ respects the period structure
  -- The key insight: f s must have a period that allows return in n < 360 steps
  -- But s has period 45, which is in Gap45, so any valid transformation
  -- must preserve the gap structure or create an even more complex period
  -- If f s has period p and ℛ^[n] (f s) = s, then n must be a multiple of p
  -- and also must allow the phase to align correctly
  -- Since s is in Gap45, its period is 45, and return to s requires
  -- the phase relationships to work out, which forces n ≥ 360

    -- For ℛ^[n] (f s) = s to hold, we need n to be compatible with both
