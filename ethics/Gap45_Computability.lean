theorem no_computable_gap_resolver :
  ¬∃ (f : RecognitionState → RecognitionState),
    isComputable f ∧
    ∀ s : RecognitionState, Gap45 s →
      ∃ n : ℕ, n < 360 ∧ n > 0 ∧ ℛ^[n] (f s) = s := by
  -- Proof by diagonalization
  intro ⟨f, hcomp, hresolve⟩
  -- f is computable, so it appears in our enumeration
  obtain ⟨cf, hcf⟩ := hcomp
  obtain ⟨k, hk⟩ := enumeration_complete cf
  -- Consider the diagonal state for k
  let s := diagonalState k
  -- This state is in Gap45

    · norm_num  -- 5 | 45
    · norm_num  -- ¬(8 | 45)
  -- By hypothesis, f can resolve it quickly
  obtain ⟨n, hn_small, hn_pos, hn_resolve⟩ := hresolve s hgap
  -- But by period_blowup, any return requires ≥ 360 steps
  have himpossible := gap_cycle_length s hgap n hn_small hn_pos
  -- We need to show that ℛ^[n] (f s) = s implies n is a common multiple
  -- This would require showing that ℛ respects the period structure

lemma gap_navigator_noncomputable (f : RecognitionState → RecognitionState) :
  (∀ s : RecognitionState, Gap45 s → ∃ n : ℕ, n ≤ 8 ∧ ℛ^[n] (f s) = s) →
  ¬isComputable f := by
  intro h_nav h_comp
  -- If f navigates gaps in ≤ 8 steps and is computable,
  -- we can extend it to a full resolver, contradicting the theorem
  sorry  -- Would complete the argument
