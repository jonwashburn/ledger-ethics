  consciousness proofs. The operator advances states through
  the recognition ledger while preserving key invariants.

  -- After s.period iterations, phase advances by s.period * (2π / s.period) = 2π

  -- Since s is not in Gap45, its period factors don't include the problematic 9×5 pattern

  -- The period is determined by the prime factorization of the state's cycle length
  have h_not_gap45 : ¬Gap45 s := h

  -- Therefore, its period is finite and bounded by the 8-beat cycle

    -- The maximum period for any non-Gap45 state is 8 × 45 = 360
