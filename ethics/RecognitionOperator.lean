  Recognition Operator

  Minimal interface for the recognition operator ℛ needed for
  consciousness proofs. The operator advances states through
  the recognition ledger while preserving key invariants.

  fun s => {
    phase := s.phase + 2 * Real.pi / s.period
    amplitude := s.amplitude  -- Unitary preserves amplitude
    voxel := s.voxel  -- This is simplified; real version would update voxel

notation "ℛ" => RecognitionOperator

/-- Recognition operator preserves period -/
lemma recognition_preserves_period (s : RecognitionState) :
  (ℛ s).period = s.period := by
  simp [RecognitionOperator]

/-- Recognition operator is periodic with the state's period -/
lemma recognition_periodic (s : RecognitionState) :
  (ℛ^[s.period] s).phase = s.phase + 2 * Real.pi * s.period / s.period := by
  simp [RecognitionOperator]
  sorry  -- Would need full implementation

/-- For states not in Gap45, recognition eventually returns to start -/
lemma recognition_returns (s : RecognitionState) (h : ¬Gap45 s) :
  ∃ n : ℕ, n > 0 ∧ n ≤ 360 ∧ ℛ^[n] s = s := by
  -- If not in Gap45, then either:
  -- 1. period divides 8 (returns in ≤ 8 steps)
  -- 2. period doesn't have the problematic 9,5 factors
  sorry  -- This would require more detailed analysis

/-- Key property: Recognition preserves unitarity (simplified) -/
axiom recognition_unitary : ∀ s : RecognitionState,
  s.amplitude^2 = (ℛ s).amplitude^2
