  Recognition Operator

  Minimal interface for the recognition operator ℱ needed for
  consciousness proofs. The operator advances states through
  the recognition ledger while preserving key invariants.

notation "ℛ" => RecognitionOperator

/-- Recognition operator is periodic with the state's period -/
theorem recognition_periodic (s : RecognitionState) :
  ∃ (phase' : ℝ), (ℛ^[s.period] s).phase = phase' := by
  -- After s.period iterations, phase advances by s.period * (2π / s.period) = 2π
  use s.phase + 2 * Real.pi
  -- This follows from the definition of ℛ and function iteration
  sorry -- Requires formalization of function iteration for RecognitionOperator

/-- For states not in Gap45, recognition eventually returns to start -/
theorem recognition_returns (s : RecognitionState) (h : ¬Gap45 s) :
  ∃ n : ℕ, n > 0 ∧ n ≤ 360 ∧ ℛ^[n] s = s := by
  -- For non-Gap45 states, the period divides some number ≤ 360
  -- This follows from the mathematical structure of periods not in Gap45
  sorry -- Requires connecting to the period analysis in Gap45.lean
